// TODO: Create a small Express server for signing on and signing off

// The idea here is to create a React Native app with some buttons for sending hello/goodbye messages quickly
// to the Shift Lab Slack instance.

// One challenge to overcome so far:
// - How do we handle authentication/user identification? Expose a route to register devices? Authenticate with Slack?
